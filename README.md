# Eclipse_lib

This repository contains my personal templates and libs.

you could use the code below to include my lib:
```cpp
#define SYONE_LIB
using namespace syone;
```
Structure:

basics
- input.h

optimize
- range.h

traits
- constant_type.h

Now my aim is to recreate a <type_traits> myself in /traits.
